### Hi thereğŸ‘‹
I'm Roghayeh 
I am a lover of programming, I have a bachelor's degree, first of all, fate put me on this path and I had to deal with tools that I didn't like every day because of my studies. But slowly I was fascinated by all this power . I started learning web development with PHP and now I'm thirsty learning. ğŸ˜„ğŸŒ±.
